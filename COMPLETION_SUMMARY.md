├── Frontend (Secure)
│   ├── Modern authentication
│   ├── API integration
│   └── AI assistant
├── Backend API
│   ├── PHP 8 + MySQL
│   ├── RESTful endpoints
│   └── Proper validation
└── Database
    ├── User management
    ├── Progress tracking
    └── Content management
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

1. **Initialize Database**

   ```bash
   php setup.php
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**

   ```bash
   # Edit .env with your actual credentials
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASS=your_db_password
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

4. **Access Platform**
   - Visit: http://localhost:8000
   - Test API: http://localhost:8000/api/health
   - Try AI assistant on any page
