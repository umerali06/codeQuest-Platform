# API Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 404 Errors for API Endpoints

**Problem**: Browser was getting 404 errors when trying to access `/api/modules` and `/api/config/appwrite`

**Root Cause**:

- API routing logic had incorrect array indexing after `array_filter()`
- Missing proper setup in modules.php file
- CLI compatibility issues with `getallheaders()` function

**Solutions**:

- Fixed routing logic in `api/index.php` by using `array_values(array_filter())`
- Added proper CLI mode detection for `getallheaders()` function
- Cleaned up modules.php to properly inherit variables from index.php
- Created router.php for PHP development server compatibility

### 2. Missing Appwrite Configuration Endpoint

**Problem**: `/api/config/appwrite` was returning 404

**Solution**:

- Verified config.php properly handles appwrite configuration requests
- Added proper error handling and fallback values
- Endpoint now returns correct Appwrite configuration from .env files

### 3. Development Server Setup

**Problem**: .htaccess rewrite rules don't work with PHP built-in development server

**Solution**:

- Created `router.php` for proper request routing in development
- Added `start-dev-server.bat` and `start-dev-server.sh` scripts
- Users can now run `php -S localhost:8080 router.php` or use the provided scripts

## Files Modified

### Core API Files

- `api/index.php` - Fixed routing logic and CLI compatibility
- `api/modules.php` - Cleaned up to properly inherit from index.php
- `api/config.php` - Verified appwrite config handling

### Development Setup

- `router.php` - New router for PHP development server
- `start-dev-server.bat` - Windows batch script to start server
- `start-dev-server.sh` - Unix shell script to start server
- `.htaccess` - Updated rewrite rules (for Apache servers)

## Testing Results

✅ **Modules API** (`/api/modules`) - Returns complete module data with user progress
✅ **Appwrite Config API** (`/api/config/appwrite`) - Returns proper configuration
✅ **CLI Compatibility** - All APIs work in both web and CLI environments
✅ **Development Server** - Router properly handles API and static file requests

## How to Test

1. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   # Windows
   start-dev-server.bat

   # Unix/Linux/Mac
   ./start-dev-server.sh

   # Manual
   php -S localhost:8080 router.php
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoints**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/api/modules`
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/api/config/appwrite`
   - Load the learn.html page to test full integration

## Next Steps

The 404 errors should now be resolved. The remaining authentication issues (401 errors) are related to Appwrite session management and are separate from the API routing problems that have been fixed.
